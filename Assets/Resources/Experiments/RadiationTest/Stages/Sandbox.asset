  description: 'Experiment with different sources of radiation to see how they measure
    on the Geiger counter. '
  explanation: 'Materials can release various forms of radiation, in this example
    alpha, beta and gamma radiation is modelled. Each have different speeds, sizes,
    and penetration power.

    Try moving each sample nearer/further from the counter,
    and placing different materials in between using the ''toggle barriers'' button,
    to compare properties and guess which types of radiation are released from each
    sample.'
