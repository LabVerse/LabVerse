  title: Burn Lithium
  description: Grab the loop, dip it into the copper tray (grey coloured), and hold
    the loop over the flame.
  explanation: When lithium is introduced into the flame, the heat causes the electrons
    in the lithium atoms to become excited and move to higher energy levels. As these
    excited electrons return to their ground state, they release energy in the form
    of light. The specific color observed in the flame (bright crimson or red) is
    characteristic of lithium.
