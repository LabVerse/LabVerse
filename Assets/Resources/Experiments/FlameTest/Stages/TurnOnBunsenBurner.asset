  title: Ignite the Bunsen Burner.
  description: Press the 'toggle' button near the bunsen burner twice, to make it
    into a blue flame.
  explanation: The Bunsen burner produces a hot, blue flame due to the complete combustion
    of gas (usually methane or natural gas) with the surrounding oxygen. The blue
    color indicates that the fuel is burning efficiently, with sufficient oxygen
    present for combustion.
