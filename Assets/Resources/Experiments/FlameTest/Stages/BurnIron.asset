  title: Burn Iron
  description: Grab the loop, dip it into the iron tray (orange coloured), and hold
    the loop over the flame.
  explanation: When the iron compound is heated in the flame, the heat excites the
    electrons in the iron atoms, causing them to jump to higher energy levels. As
    these electrons return to their ground state, they emit light energy. The specific
    color observed in the flame (yellow-orange) is characteristic of iron.
