  title: Burn Copper
  description: Grab the loop, dip it into the copper tray (blue coloured), and hold
    the loop over the flame.
  explanation: When the copper is introduced into the flame, the heat causes the
    electrons in the copper atoms to become excited and jump to higher energy levels.
    As the electrons return to their ground state, they release energy in the form
    of light. The specific color observed in the flame (blue-green) is characteristic
    of copper.
