  title: Sterilise the Inoculating Loop
  description: "Ignite the bunsen burner then hold your inoculating loop through
    the hot flame until it glows red. Remove from the heat and allow it some time
    to cool down.\r\r"
  explanation: Sterilisation of the inoculating loop is crucial to prevent contamination
    of the agar plate with unwanted microorganisms. Heating the loop to a high temperature
    kills any bacteria or fungi present on its surface.
