  title: Sealing The Petri Dish
  description: "Close the petri dish lid. This is done to prevent contamination.\r"
  explanation: Sealing the petri dish helps to maintain a sterile environment inside,
    minimising the risk of airborne contaminants from entering and interfering with
    bacterial growth. However, it's important to allow for some airflow to facilitate
    the exchange of gases necessary for bacterial metabolism.
