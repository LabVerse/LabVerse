  title: Preparing Agar Plate
  description: "In a sterile environment, open the agar bottle, take off the petri
    dish lid, and pour the hot agar jelly into the round, clear petri dish. Allow
    the agar jelly to cool and solidify.\r\r"
  explanation: Agar is a gel-like substance derived from seaweed that provides a
    nutrient-rich medium for bacteria to grow. By pouring hot agar jelly into a petri
    dish and allowing it to solidify, we create a surface for bacterial colonies
    to develop.
