  title: Bacterial Growth
  description: "Place the petri dish upside down. This prevents condensation droplets
    falling onto the agar jelly surface.\r\nLeave the plate at around 25\xB0C to
    allow the culture to grow. In schools, bacteria are not grown at temperatures
    above 25\xB0C as harmful pathogens are more likely to grow above this temperature.\r\r\nAfter
    leaving the petri dish for some time, you will notice bacterial colonies appearing
    on the surface of the agar jelly.\r\r\r"
