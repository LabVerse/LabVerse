  title: Bacterial Growth
  description: Place the sealed petri dish upside down to prevent condensation droplets
    from falling onto the agar jelly surface. After a bit of time, take the lid off
    the petri dish to see the grown bacteria.
  explanation: "By placing the petri dish upside down, we prevent condensation from
    accumulating on the agar surface, which could dilute or disrupt bacterial growth.
    Incubating the plate at a controlled temperature allows the bacteria to proliferate
    without promoting the growth of harmful pathogens, as temperatures above 25\xB0C
    can be conducive to their growth. Over time, bacterial colonies will become visible
    on the agar surface, representing the growth and proliferation of the inoculated
    bacteria."
