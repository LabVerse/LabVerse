  title: Spreading the Bacteria
  description: "Using the sterilized inoculating loop, carefully spread a sample
    of bacteria onto the surface of the agar jelly plate in a zigzag motion.\r\r"
  explanation: By spreading the bacteria onto the agar plate, we provide an opportunity
    for individual bacterial cells to grow and multiply into visible colonies. Ensuring
    an even spread of bacteria helps to observe and analyse bacterial growth patterns.
